This is my first android application.
You can use it to test your math knowledge.

In general questions are of structure like:
a # b = c
where a,b,c are some numbers (any of them can be missing)
and # is some operator (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

You can choose any of the available modes and practice questions there as long as you like
There are no restrictions

There are 4 main modes:
for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division
plus mode "Everything" where every question can be with any operator

If you made a mistake, you can try that question again in "Retry incorrect questions" mode

In settings you can find 3 levels of difficulty, as well as mode for division questions

Difficulties:
+1 level - you gain 1 point if answered correctly and -1 if answered wrong

+2 level - you gain 2 points if answered correctly and -1 if answered wrong

+3 level - you gain 3 points if answered correctly and -1 if answered wrong

Division mode:
+Simple: a is chosen randomly, and b is one of divisors of a. This means that answer c will always be whole number
+Fractions: both a and b are chosen randomly, which leads to answer c being fraction number
            In this mode you will always be asked only to find the answer.
            However you need to type the anser only to it's tenth (still need to round),
            so if you count and the answer is 1.55 -> write 1.6 as the answer
